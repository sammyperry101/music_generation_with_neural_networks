# Music Generation with Neural Networks

This project involves utilising various neural network architectures to generate music.

The runnable file for this project is GUI.py, and can be opened and run using Python or Visual Studio Code.

There are example MIDI files in the MIDI-Examples folder which can be loaded to generate notes on the different models.

The following modules are required to run this code:
- pytorch: https://pytorch.org/
- numpy: https://numpy.org/install/
- pathlib: https://pypi.org/project/pathlib/
- utils: https://pypi.org/project/python-utils/ 
- pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html 
- pretty_midi: https://pypi.org/project/pretty_midi/
